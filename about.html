                    <h3>Craft Your Design gives an ideas and video tutorial recommendations for different art journal design.</h3>
                    <p>An art journal is an easy way to help you connect with your creative self. This self-directed process allows a freedom of expression that will empower your thinking and give you courage. Art journaling is a visual diary where you can creatively express your ideas, thoughts, feelings, memories and emotions through any type of art form you enjoy. You have endless possibilities for artistic experimentation as your journal can be as unique as you are. You can write, draw, sketch, paint, scribble, collage, photograph, rip, tear, stamp, glue, sew, print and create in any way you choose. You can write about different things such as your day, what you ate for breakfast, favourite songs, places to visit, who annoyed you last week, what you have on your to-do list and more. You might prefer to focus more on the visual expression with images and colours with very few or no words at all. The options are endless!</p>
